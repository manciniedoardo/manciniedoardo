My name is Edoardo Mancini and I am a Senior Data Scientist working at Roche. I'm very interested in R and pushing th e adoption ofopen-source solutions (such as those in the [pharmaverse](https://github.com/pharmaverse)) within the pharmaceutical industry.

I'm Gabe. I do research and consulting in statistical computing with R and frequently collaborate with the R-core development team to add new features to the R language.

My particular areas of interest are:

- Reproducibility and Provenance of ad-hoc analyses
- Improving the R language
- Bridging gaps between sections of the R community
